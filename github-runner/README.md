This is a config for a self hosted Github runner.

## Deployment
`docker compose up -d`

## Environment Variables
Provide these to `docker compose`, for instance by having them in `.env` file in the same directory.

#### Container Runtime Configuration
- `CONTAINER_NAME`: The name of the Docker container running the GitHub runner.  
  *Example*: `project-x-github-runner`.
- `CPUS`: The number of CPU cores allocated to the GitHub runner container.  
  *Example*: `2`.
- `MEMORY`: The amount of memory allocated to the GitHub runner container. Use standard Docker memory allocation syntax (e.g., `512m`, `2g`).  
  *Example*: `4g`.


#### Runner Configuration
- `REPO_URL`:  The URL of the GitHub repository where the runner will be registered.  
  *Example*: `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository`.
- `RUNNER_TOKEN`: The registration token generated by GitHub for adding a self-hosted runner to a repository.
- `RUNNER_NAME` *(optional)*: The name of the runner as it will appear in GitHub.  
- `RUNNER_LABELS` *(optional)*: A comma-separated list of labels to apply to the runner. By default the runner will have the label `self-hosted`, the OS type and the architecture (like `self-hosted,linux,x64`).  
  *Example for additional labels you may pass*: `gpu,very-cool-server`.

*Note*: You can find all of these variable values on GitHub in your repository at **Settings > Actions > Runners > New self-hosted runner**. Select `Linux` and the architecture you plan on running on your docker host.
